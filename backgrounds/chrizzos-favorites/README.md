# Chrizzo's Favorites

Be aware: This is by no means an elaborate art project. There's a lot of people out there who create gorgeous themes (or customizations), I am not one of them and I do not claim to be!

I just took some screenshots from some of my all-time favorite games to customize my Art-Book-Next experience. This pack only contains screenshots from systems I actually play, from games I truly love and consider great representatives of the respective system. The screenshots are made to tie in with the default screenshots that already come with Art-Book-Next.

Feel free to use them, add them to your own screenshot pack if you like, do whatever floats your boat! There's no need to mention me, no need to give thanks, really. It's just screenshots, have fun with them!

Happy gaming!

## How to use

Download the image set (or just pick the ones you like!) and drop it in your `theme-customizations/art-book-next/artwork` folder on your device (or check out the theme documentation [here](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/art-book-next-es)). Afterwards, go to the *Theme Settings* and make sure to set *System Artwork* to *Custom* to enable the custom artworks.

## How to add your own

Since I only covered the very few systems I currently play, I'd suggest you try making your own screenshots and throw 'em in the mix!

I followed [Ant's](https://github.com/anthonycaccese) advice to get the best results:

- To avoid any shader or scaling effects, I took the screenshots
    - either while playing with *RetroArch* cores with *GPU Screenshot* turned *off* in the *Video* settings, or
    - via *DosBox* and *ScummVM* in each game's original resolution on my computer.
- Afterwards, I used [Pixel Art Scaler](https://lospec.com/pixel-art-scaler/) to upscale the images without any blur or distortion.

Try the same! Make your own! Which games are *your* favorites you desperately want to show off?
