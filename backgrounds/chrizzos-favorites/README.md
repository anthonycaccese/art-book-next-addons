# Chrizzo's Favorites

Be aware: This is by no means an elaborate art project. There's a lot of people out there who create gorgeous themes (or customizations), I am not one of them and I do not claim to be!

However, as a user of [KNULLI](https://www.knulli.org), I have customized the great Art-Book-Next theme a **tiny** bit. In this package you find

* my `artwork` folder with alternative screenshots for some different systems *I* play which reflect *my* taste in gaming and focus some games that *I* consider to be defining for the respective system
* my KNULLI Bootlogo
    * in 640x480 resolution (for the Anbernic RG35XX H/Plus/SP series and the RG40XX H)
    * in 1280x720 resolution (for the TrimUI Smart Pro)
* my KNULLI Art Book Next splash screen
    * in 640x480 resolution (for the Anbernic RG35XX H/Plus/SP series and the RG40XX H)
    * in 1280x720 resolution (for the TrimUI Smart Pro)
* my minor changes to `colors.xml` to adapt the color of the ES progress bar to KNULLI green

## How to use

You can adopt my entire theme customization or just pick the bits you want for your own setup.

### Artworks

To adopt my artworks, download the image set from the `artwork` folder (or just pick the ones you like!) and drop the images in your `theme-customizations/art-book-next/artwork` folder on your device (or check out the theme documentation [here](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/art-book-next-es)). Afterwards, go to the *Theme Configuration* and make sure to set *System Artwork* to *Custom* to enable the custom artworks.

### Colors

To adopt my color settings, simply drop my `colors.xml` in your `theme-customizations/art-book-next` folder.

### Splash screen

To adopt my splash screen, download the splash screen that fits your device resolution, put it in `theme-customizations/art-book-next` **and rename it** to `splash.png`. Afterwards, go to the *Theme Configuration* and make sure to set *Splash Screen* to *Custom* to enable the custom splash screen.

I do not take any credit for this image, it is the same image that was used as bootlogo on the first KNULLI builds before it was called "KNULLI" and hat its down logo. I simply re-uploaded the file to make it available for others.

### Bootlogo

To use my KNULLI bootlogo, download the `.bmp` file that suits the resolution of your screen and replace your existing `bootlogo.bmp` with the new one. You will find more detailed instructions in the [KNULLI wiki](https://knulli.org/configure/customization/bootlogo/).

The provided KNULLI bootlogo is a combination of the original KNULLI logo and the wallpaper that was used on the earliest KNULLI builds before it was called "KNULLI". I do not take credit for either the KNULLI logo or the wallpaper behind it, I just combined the two images because they look great together.

## About the artworks

I just took some screenshots from some of my all-time favorite games to customize my Art-Book-Next experience. This pack only contains screenshots from systems I actually play, from games I truly love and consider great representatives of the respective system. The screenshots are made to tie in with the default screenshots that already come with Art-Book-Next.

Feel free to use them, add them to your own screenshot pack if you like, do whatever floats your boat! There's no need to mention me, no need to give thanks, really. It's just screenshots, have fun with them!

Happy gaming!

### How to add your own

Since I only covered the very few systems I currently play, I'd suggest you try making your own screenshots and throw 'em in the mix!

I followed [Ant's](https://github.com/anthonycaccese) advice to get the best results:

- To avoid any shader or scaling effects, I took the screenshots
    - either while playing with *RetroArch* cores with *GPU Screenshot* turned *off* in the *Video* settings, or
    - via *DosBox* and *ScummVM* in each game's original resolution on my computer.
- Afterwards, I used [Pixel Art Scaler](https://lospec.com/pixel-art-scaler/) to upscale the images without any blur or distortion.

Try the same! Make your own! Which games are *your* favorites you desperately want to show off?
