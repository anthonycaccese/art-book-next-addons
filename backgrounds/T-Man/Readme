Here's some custom images.
Some of them are quite similar to stock. The idea is to frame characters a bit higher up. Doesn't look too good when they're standing on the black button-prompt bar (at least not on my cube).
Also, to have some diversity, and not just Sonic featured on most sega screenshots.
I've picked some of my favourite games from each of these systems, and I'm quite happy with all of them. Perhaps the Psx alternative screenshot isn't all that good.
The ps1 needs to be renamed to psx.png before use. For some reason, naming it psx here isn't working well.
An alternative for the Dreamcast featuring Vyse instead of Aika is also present here, just rename that one to dreamcast.png.
Some of them are a bit fabricated using sprites and photoshop.
The only odd one out would be the C64 game, since, I don't think this game really exists for the c64.
