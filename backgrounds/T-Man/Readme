Here's some custom images.
Some of them are quite similar to stock. The idea is to frame characters a bit higher up. Doesn't look too good when they're standing on the black button-prompt bar (at least not on my cube).
Also, to have some diversity, and not just Sonic featured on most sega screenshots.
I've picked some of my favourite games from each of these systems, and I'm quite happy with all of them. Perhaps the Psx screenshot isn't all that good.
An alternative for the Dreamcast featuring Vyse instead of Aika is also present here.
